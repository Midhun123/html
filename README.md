Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. 

The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is a title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
  </body>
</html>

HTML is  extended from	SGML(Standard Generalized Markup Language)
Generalized markup is based on two postulates:

Markup should be declarative: it should describe a document's structure and other attributes, rather than specify the processing to be performed on it. Declarative markup is less likely to conflict with unforeseen future processing needs and techniques.
Markup should be rigorous so that the techniques available for processing rigorously-defined objects like programs and databases can be used for processing documents as well.
